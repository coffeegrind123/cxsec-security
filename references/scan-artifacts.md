# Scan Artifact Paths

Use these shared path conventions for security scan workflows unless the user explicitly provides different input or output paths.

## Base Paths

- `cxsec_home=$CXSEC_HOME` (vendored runtime root, default `~/.claude/codex-security`)
- `repo_name=<basename of repo_root>`
- `target_id=<stable scan target identity from scan-contract.md>`
- `system_temp_dir=<platform temporary directory>`
- `security_scans_dir=<system_temp_dir>/codex-security-scans/<repo_name>`
- `scan_id=<commit>_<scan timestamp>`
- `scan_dir=<security_scans_dir>/<scan_id>`
- `target_paths_file=<explicitly enumerated scoped-path file>` when the user supplies one. Treat it as read-only scope input: pass it directly to `make-repo-scope-input --scopes-file` and `bind-repo-scopes --scopes-file` before finalization, and do not print, evaluate, modify, or treat its contents as shell syntax.
- `artifacts_dir=<scan_dir>/artifacts`
- `context_dir=<artifacts_dir>/01_context`
- `discovery_dir=<artifacts_dir>/02_discovery`
- `coverage_dir=<artifacts_dir>/03_coverage`
- `reconciliation_dir=<artifacts_dir>/04_reconciliation`
- `findings_dir=<artifacts_dir>/05_findings`

The plugin resolves the platform temporary directory automatically. For a manual workflow, use the active process temporary directory (for example, `%TEMP%` on Windows or `$TMPDIR` when configured on Unix-like hosts) instead of hardcoding `/tmp`.

Resolve `<python_command>` to the configured Python interpreter (`"$PYTHON"` when one is provided), otherwise use `python3`.

## Threat Model (Phase 1) Paths

- Resolved SECURITY.md guidance: `<context_dir>/security_guidance.md`
- Repository-scoped threat model: `<security_scans_dir>/threat_model.md`
- Per-scan threat model copy: `<context_dir>/threat_model.md`
- Later scan phases should treat `<context_dir>/threat_model.md` as the source of truth.
- When a repository-scoped threat model already exists, copy it to `<context_dir>/threat_model.md` without alteration for auditability.

End each repository-scoped threat model with these two lines:

- `Repository: <target_id>`
- `Version: <revision for an immutable Git tree; snapshot digest otherwise>`

## Finding Discovery (Phase 2) Paths

### Deep Rounds And Compact Diff Discovery

A repository scan writes its findings and coverage straight into the unsealed canonical files. A deep scan runs complete repository-scan rounds; each round checkpoints as it works and returns its final validated findings, coverage, threat model, and optional scope as `result.json`. Pending candidates retain their original evidence in `coverage.deferred`. A checkpoint alone is never an accepted complete round result. The coordinator semantically reduces the completed round results and writes the parent scan's unsealed `scan-manifest.json`, `findings.json`, and `coverage.json`; it does not rerun validation or attack-path phases or author a second draft. Diff scans retain the compact artifacts described below.

- A diff scan writes raw candidates to `<discovery_dir>/raw_candidates.jsonl` and normalizes them once into `<discovery_dir>/candidates.jsonl` with `normalize_candidates.py`; read the normalized set from that file.
  - Normalization validates candidates against assigned source paths, merges rows with the same CWE ids, locations, and optional instance, preserves their text, and assigns deterministic `candidate_id` values.
  - After normalization, compact validation adds exactly one `validation` object to every row with `disposition` (`reportable`, `suppressed`, `not_applicable`, or `deferred`), `method`, `confidence` (`high`, `medium`, or `low`), `confidence_rationale`, concise `rubric` and `evidence`, `counterevidence_or_proof_gap`, `remaining_uncertainty`, and optional `artifact_paths`. Add `source`, `control`, `sink`, or `preconditions` only when they clarify or differ from the discovery fields.
  - Compact attack-path analysis adds exactly one `attack_path` object to each validation row marked `reportable` or `deferred`, with `decision` (`reportable`, `ignore`, or `deferred`), `dataflow`, `reachability`, `counterevidence`, `impact` and `likelihood` (`high`, `medium`, `low`, `ignore`, or `unknown`), `severity` (`critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`, `ignore`, or `unknown`), `severity_rationale`, `change_conditions`, and `proof_gap` when deferred. A `reportable` decision requires severity `critical`, `high`, `medium`, or `low`; `ignore` requires severity `ignore`; `deferred` uses a provisional reportable severity or `unknown`.
  - Append all validations and all eligible attack-path decisions as receipts in `<findings_dir>/<candidate_id>/candidate_ledger.jsonl`. Preserve every discovery field and the candidate order from `candidates.jsonl`.
- Optional compact validation evidence: `<discovery_dir>/validation_artifacts/<candidate_id>/`
  - Create this directory only for actual PoCs, crafted inputs, or logs and reference those paths from the row's `validation` object. Do not create placeholder per-candidate directories or narrative reports.

The worklist, per-finding receipt, and phase-report paths below apply to diff workflows. Repository and deep scans assemble validated findings directly, without persisted candidate ledgers or per-finding receipts.

### Diff Discovery And Coverage

- Advisory seed research: `<context_dir>/seed_research.md`
- Changed source input: `<discovery_dir>/rank_input.jsonl`
- Scoped deep-review input: `<discovery_dir>/deep_review_input.jsonl` if applicable
- Finding discovery report: `<discovery_dir>/finding_discovery_report.md`

### Deep Review

- Scoped work ledger: `<discovery_dir>/work_ledger.jsonl` if applicable
- Scoped raw candidates: `<discovery_dir>/raw_candidates.jsonl` if applicable

### Candidate Reconciliation

- Compact Diff candidate ledger: `<discovery_dir>/candidate_ledger.jsonl`
- Standalone or legacy Diff candidate findings directory: `<findings_dir>/`
- Standalone or legacy Diff per-finding directory: `<findings_dir>/<candidate_id>/`
- Standalone or legacy Diff per-finding candidate ledger: `<findings_dir>/<candidate_id>/candidate_ledger.jsonl`
- Scoped dedupe report: `<reconciliation_dir>/dedupe_report.md` if applicable
- Scoped deduped candidates: `<reconciliation_dir>/deduped_candidates.jsonl` if applicable

### Coverage

- Repository-wide coverage ledger: `<coverage_dir>/repository_coverage_ledger.md`
  - This is a coverage artifact, not a findings list: it should include checked surfaces with not_applicable, suppressed, deferred, or reportable dispositions.
- Reviewed surfaces summary: `<coverage_dir>/reviewed_surfaces.md` if applicable

## Validation (Phase 3) Paths

Repository scans and deep-scan rounds include validation directly in their final finding semantics. Diff scans record validation as a `validation` receipt per candidate and may use the optional compact evidence path above. Standalone diff workflows may also use these paths:

- Scan-level validation summary: `<findings_dir>/validation_summary.md` if applicable
- Per-finding validation report: `<findings_dir>/<candidate_id>/validation_report.md`
- Per-finding validation artifacts: `<findings_dir>/<candidate_id>/validation_artifacts/`

## Attack-Path Analysis (Phase 4) Paths

Repository scans and deep-scan rounds include attack-path analysis directly in their final finding semantics. Diff scans record attack-path decisions as an `attack_path` receipt per eligible candidate. Standalone diff workflows may also use these paths:

- Scan-level attack-path analysis report: `<findings_dir>/attack_path_analysis_report.md` if applicable
- Per-finding attack-path analysis report: `<findings_dir>/<candidate_id>/attack_path_analysis_report.md`

## Final Report Paths

- Unsealed canonical draft: `<scan_dir>/scan-manifest.json`, `<scan_dir>/findings.json`, `<scan_dir>/coverage.json`
- Deep round result: `<discovery_dir>/rounds/round-<k>/result.json`; the coordinator writes the aggregated parent draft
- In-flight checkpoint: `<scan_dir>/checkpoint-findings.json` and `<discovery_dir>/worker-<label>.json`
- Completed results: the sealed `<scan_dir>/scan-manifest.json` plus the generated `<scan_dir>/report.md`
- Final scan report: `<scan_dir>/report.md`
- Detailed vulnerability write-up: `<scan_dir>/findings/<slug>/<slug>.md`
- Per-finding PoC and supporting files: `<scan_dir>/findings/<slug>/poc/...`
- Structural hardening portfolio: `<scan_dir>/hardening/hardening.md`
- Hardening analysis, proposals, and diagrams: `<scan_dir>/hardening/...`
- Final report validation notes, when validation fails: `<scan_dir>/report_validation.md`

## Fix Finding Paths

- Fix report, when using an existing scan artifact directory: `<artifacts_dir>/fix_report.md`

## Placement Rules

- Put scan phase outputs and supporting evidence under the numbered artifact subdirectories above.
- Keep fix-finding outputs outside the numbered scan phases because fix-finding can run standalone or against an existing scan.
- Do not author the final `report.md` directly. Put complete scan-level report semantics in the canonical JSON files. Detailed per-finding prose in `findings/<slug>/<slug>.md` and derived design guidance under `hardening/` are optional for every scan mode. Finalization deterministically writes the unsealed `report.md` projection and links any recorded write-ups and hardening portfolio. Do not add these derived documents to the sealed artifact list.
- Keep the full scan bundle together under `scan_dir`.

# codex-security → Claude Code port

Port of the security-review doctrine from
[openai/codex-security](https://github.com/openai/codex-security) to Claude Code.
Apache-2.0. See `PROVENANCE.md` for the exact upstream version and commit.

## What is installed

**This runtime** (`~/.claude/codex-security`, referred to as `$CXSEC_HOME`):

- `scripts/` — 34 stdlib-only Python helpers. No pip install, no network calls,
  no OpenAI credentials.
- `schemas/` — 12 JSON Schemas for the scan contract.
- `references/` — the full upstream shared reference set, including
  `validation-guidance.md`-adjacent material kept for the skills still to be ported.
- `preflight/capability-profiles.toml` — capability gate definitions.
- `examples/completed-scan/` — upstream example artifacts, used as the installer's
  end-to-end smoke fixture.

Install, repair, or verify this runtime with the skill's installer:
`bash ~/.claude/skills/cxsec-security/scripts/install.sh [--check|--force]`.
It vendors the pinned upstream tree, re-applies the SARIF rebrand patch, and proves
the result by finalizing the example scan. See `references/install.md` in the skill.

**One skill** at `~/.claude/skills/cxsec-security/` — a router `SKILL.md` (~2k tok)
plus 36 on-demand reference files (~105k tok total, loaded per mode):

| # | Mode | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Repository scan (default) | `mode-repo-scan.md` |
| 2 | Diff scan (PR/commit/branch/patch) | `mode-diff-scan.md` |
| 3 | Deep multi-pass scan | `mode-deep-scan.md` |
| 4 | Triage existing findings | `mode-triage.md` |
| 5 | Fix and verify a finding | `mode-fix.md` |
| 6 | Vulnerability write-up | `mode-writeup.md` |
| 7 | Author/review `SECURITY.md` | `mode-policy.md` |
| 8 | File findings (Linear/Jira/GitHub) | `mode-track.md` |
| 9 | Structural hardening | `mode-harden.md` |

Modes 1–3 invoke `phase-1-threat-model.md` → `phase-2-discovery.md` →
`phase-3-validation.md` → `phase-4-attack-path.md` internally. Phase files are
never entry points.

`references/workbench-file-protocol.md` is the authoritative mapping from every
upstream MCP tool to its file-based replacement. Read it before any scan mode.

## The load-bearing constraint

`finalize_scan_contract.py` resolves schemas as `<script_parent>/../schemas`, so
**`scripts/` and `schemas/` must remain siblings.** Moving one breaks report
generation.

## Generating a report

The finalizer is the payload: it validates hand-authored canonical artifacts and
deterministically emits `report.md` plus SARIF 2.1.0.

```bash
python3 $CXSEC_HOME/scripts/finalize_scan_contract.py \
  --scan-dir <scan_dir> --source-root <repo_root>
```

Author `scan-manifest.json`, `findings.json`, and `coverage.json` in `<scan_dir>`
as an **unsealed draft**: omit `scan.sealedAt` and `scan.artifacts`, and omit each
finding's `findingId`, `occurrenceId`, and `fingerprints`. The finalizer derives
those deterministically. Supplying them by hand fails validation.

`scan.target.snapshotDigest` is required for `git_worktree`, `git_diff`, and
`directory_snapshot` target kinds. Compute it with:

```bash
cd $CXSEC_HOME/scripts && python3 -c "
import sys; sys.path.insert(0,'.')
from pathlib import Path
import workbench_target as wt
print(wt.worktree_content_digest(Path('<repo_root>')))"
```

Related helpers: `validate_scan_contract.py` (check without sealing),
`validate_report_format.py --report-md <path>`, `resolve_security_md.py`,
`validate_tracking_source.py`, `generate_rank_input.py`,
`generate_in_scope_files.py`.

## Capability preflight

Bare, the preflight returns `incomplete` because runtime checks are unknown.
Declare Claude Code's actual capabilities to get `ready`:

```bash
python3 $CXSEC_HOME/scripts/config_preflight.py --skill security-scan --cwd <repo_root> \
  --runtime-check delegation_available=true \
  --runtime-check goal_tools_available=false \
  --multi-agent-runtime-owner native --multi-agent-runtime-version v2 \
  --multi-agent-session-cap 8 --multi-agent-runtime-provenance tool-surface \
  --effective-config features.goals=true
```

`goal_tools` legitimately fails — Claude Code has no goal tools — but its severity
is `suggest`, not `block`.

## Deliberately not ported

- **The upstream MCP server** (`mcp/server.mjs`). It is a local SQLite scan-state
  workbench, not a service client, and it runs without credentials — but its
  scan-start tools require a Codex thread id in MCP `_meta`, which Claude Code does
  not send. The Python layer reaches the same state directly, so the server adds
  nothing here. All 55 of its tools are mapped to file operations in
  `references/workbench-file-protocol.md`.
- **The Codex-managed deep-scan worker pool.** Upstream spawns real `codex` CLI
  subprocesses (`resolveCodexPath() → CODEX_CLI_PATH || "codex"`). `mode-deep-scan.md`
  keeps the doctrine — independent rounds, saturation via `stopAfterNoNew`, the
  discovery→tail boundary, "recurrence is search evidence, not reportability proof" —
  and runs the rounds with `Agent` subagents instead.
- **The Codex desktop setup UI, goals, handoff/claim, and remediation-request
  flows.** No equivalent exists. Coverage objectives are stated in the first visible
  update; `<scan_dir>` is the durable state.
- **Codex project GitHub attachment** as a repository-inference source. Falls back
  to the local repository's GitHub remote.

## Transport availability for mode-track

All four tracking transports are now wired:

| Transport | Status |
|---|---|
| GitHub issues / advisories | Works — pre-authenticated `gh` CLI |
| Linear | MCP server registered at user scope; **needs OAuth** |
| Jira | MCP server registered at user scope; **needs OAuth** |

```
linear    : https://mcp.linear.app/mcp        (http)
atlassian : https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/sse  (sse)
```

Complete authentication with `/mcp` in-session — it needs an interactive browser
login and cannot be done non-interactively. Until then both report
`! Needs authentication` and `mode-track` will stop rather than substitute another
transport.

Note: Linear's `/sse` endpoint returns 404 and is retired; `/mcp` streamable-HTTP
is the live one. Also, interactively-authenticated MCP servers can be absent from
headless or cron runs, so a scheduled scan may find Linear/Jira unavailable even
after you authenticate here.

`mode-track` forbids falling back to direct Jira/Linear REST with an API token.
That is an upstream disclosure-boundary rule — the OAuth connector enforces
per-user permissions while a raw token usually has broader access. Relax it only
deliberately.

## SARIF attribution

Generated SARIF is attributed to this port, not to Codex Security:

```
tool.driver.name    : cxsec-security
partialFingerprints : cxsec/v1
run.properties      : cxsecSchemaVersion, cxsecTargetKind, cxsecCoverageCompleteness
```

This is a local patch to vendored code — see `patches/README.md`. Nothing reads
these values back, but `tool.driver.name` and the `partialFingerprints` namespace
are what GitHub code scanning uses to correlate alerts across uploads, so treat
further renames as a re-baseline event.

## Porting notes

All 13 upstream skills are ported into the single `cxsec-security` skill. Changes
applied, in case you extend it:

1. Top-level skills became `references/mode-*.md`; the four phase skills became
   `references/phase-*.md`. Their frontmatter was converted to a
   `<!-- when-to-use: … -->` comment so the router can quote the trigger without a
   second frontmatter block.
2. `agents/openai.yaml` deleted — Codex-only, and the sole source of `$skill`
   self-references.
3. All reference paths flattened into one `references/` namespace: 87 path
   rewrites, 28 `$skill` → file rewrites, 16 `$codex-security:<skill>` rewrites.
4. `<plugin_dir>` / `<plugin-root>` → `$CXSEC_HOME`.
5. All 143 MCP tool references converted to file operations. The mapping lives in
   `references/workbench-file-protocol.md`; discovery/validation/attack-path state
   moved to `candidates.jsonl` plus per-candidate `candidate_ledger.jsonl`
   receipts, normalized by `normalize_candidates.py` for deterministic
   `candidate_id` values.
6. Codex app links (`app://connector_…`) → "a connected MCP server exposing …",
   with an explicit instruction to verify tool presence rather than assume it.
   "Atlassian Rovo" → Atlassian/Jira Cloud MCP tools (the underlying tool names
   like `getVisibleJiraProjects` are unchanged — they are real).
7. "Codex Security" de-branded to "security scan" in prose so mode selection is not
   gated on an absent product. **Schema string literals are unchanged** —
   `codex-security.findings`, `codex-security-snapshot/v1:…`, `codexSecurity/v1`,
   and the `source_type: codex_security_finding` enum, because the validators match
   on them.

## Verified working

End-to-end on a deliberately vulnerable Express app, with no OpenAI credentials:
preflight `ready` → `SECURITY.md` policy chain composed root→leaf → worklist →
discovery → `normalize_candidates.py` → three ledger receipts per candidate →
unsealed canonical draft → `finalize_scan_contract.py` → `status: valid`,
valid `report.md`, valid SARIF 2.1.0 with correct rule ids and severities →
`validate_tracking_source.py` reading back the derived finding ids.
